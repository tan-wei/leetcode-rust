/**
 * [2586] Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.
 * A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
 * Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
 * - "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
 * - "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
 * The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: words = ["hey","aeo","mu","ooo","artro"], left = 1, right = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * - "aeo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
 * - "mu" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.
 * - "ooo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.
 * - "artro" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
 * The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 3.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= words.length <= 1000
 * 	1 <= words[i].length <= 10
 * 	words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * 	0 <= left <= right < words.length
 *
