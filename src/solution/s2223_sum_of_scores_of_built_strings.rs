/**
 * [2223] Sum of Scores of Built Strings
 *
 * You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n, where the string with length i is labeled si.
 *
 * 	For example, for s = "abaca", s1 == "a", s2 == "ca", s3 == "aca", etc.
 *
 * The score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).
 * Given the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "babab"
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation:
 * For s1 == "b", the longest common prefix is "b" which has a score of 1.
 * For s2 == "ab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
 * For s3 == "bab", the longest common prefix is "bab" which has a score of 3.
 * For s4 == "abab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
 * For s5 == "babab", the longest common prefix is "babab" which has a score of 5.
 * The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "azbazbzaz"
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation:
 * For s2 == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
 * For s6 == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
 * For s9 == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
 * For all other si, the score is 0.
 * The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
