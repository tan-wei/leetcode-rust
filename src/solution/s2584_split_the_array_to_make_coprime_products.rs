/**
 * [2584] Split the Array to Make Coprime Products
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
 * A split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.
 *
 * 	For example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. A split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1.
 *
 * Return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split.
 * Two values val1 and val2 are coprime if gcd(val1, val2) == 1 where gcd(val1, val2) is the greatest common divisor of val1 and val2.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,7,8,15,3,5]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
 * The only valid split is at index 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,7,15,8,3,5]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
 * There is no valid split.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == nums.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^4
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
 *
