/**
 * [2350] Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls
 *
 * You are given an integer array rolls of length n and an integer k. You roll a k sided dice numbered from 1 to k, n times, where the result of the i^th roll is rolls[i].
 * Return the length of the shortest sequence of rolls so that there's no such <span data-keyword="subsequence-array">subsequence</span> in rolls.
 * A sequence of rolls of length len is the result of rolling a k sided dice len times.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: rolls = [4,2,1,2,3,3,2,4,1], k = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], [3], [4], can be taken from rolls.
 * Every sequence of rolls of length 2, [1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [4, 4], can be taken from rolls.
 * The sequence [1, 4, 2] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 3.
 * Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: rolls = [1,1,2,2], k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], can be taken from rolls.
 * The sequence [2, 1] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 2.
 * Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [2, 1] is the shortest.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: rolls = [1,1,3,2,2,2,3,3], k = 4
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The sequence [4] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 1.
 * Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [4] is the shortest.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == rolls.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= rolls[i] <= k <= 10^5
 *
