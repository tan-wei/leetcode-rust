/**
 * [2076] Process Restricted Friend Requests
 *
 * You are given an integer n indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array restrictions, where restrictions[i] = [xi, yi] means that person xi and person yi cannot become friends, either directly or indirectly through other people.
 * Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a 0-indexed 2D integer array requests, where requests[j] = [uj, vj] is a friend request between person uj and person vj.
 * A friend request is successful if uj and vj can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., requests[j] occurs before requests[j + 1]), and upon a successful request, uj and vj become direct friends for all future friend requests.
 * Return a boolean array result, where each result[j] is true if the j^th friend request is successful or false if it is not.
 * Note: If uj and vj are already direct friends, the request is still successful.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[0,2],[2,1]]
 * Output: [true,false]
 * Explanation:
 * Request 0: Person 0 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
 * Request 1: Person 2 and person 1 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (1--2--0).
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[1,2],[0,2]]
 * Output: [true,false]
 * Explanation:
 * Request 0: Person 1 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
 * Request 1: Person 0 and person 2 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--2--1).
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[3,1],[3,4]]
 * Output: [true,false,true,false]
 * Explanation:
 * Request 0: Person 0 and person 4 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
 * Request 1: Person 1 and person 2 cannot be friends since they are directly restricted.
 * Request 2: Person 3 and person 1 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
 * Request 3: Person 3 and person 4 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--4--3--1).
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	2 <= n <= 1000
 * 	0 <= restrictions.length <= 1000
 * 	restrictions[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
 * 	xi != yi
 * 	1 <= requests.length <= 1000
 * 	requests[j].length == 2
 * 	0 <= uj, vj <= n - 1
 * 	uj != vj
