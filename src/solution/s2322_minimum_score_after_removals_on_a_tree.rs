/**
 * [2322] Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree
 *
 * There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the i^th node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 * Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:
 * <ol>
 * 	Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
 * 	The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.
 * </ol>
 *
 * 	For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = <u>6</u>, 1 ^ 9 = <u>8</u>, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = <u>3</u>. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.
 *
 * Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/03/ex1drawio.png" style="width: 193px; height: 190px;" />
 * Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
 * - The 1^st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
 * - The 2^nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
 * - The 3^rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
 * The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
 * It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/03/ex2drawio.png" style="width: 287px; height: 150px;" />
 * Input: nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
 * - The 1^st component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
 * - The 2^nd component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
 * - The 3^rd component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
 * The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
 * We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == nums.length
 * 	3 <= n <= 1000
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8
 * 	edges.length == n - 1
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= ai, bi < n
 * 	ai != bi
 * 	edges represents a valid tree.
