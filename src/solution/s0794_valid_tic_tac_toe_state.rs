/**
 * [0794] Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State
 *
 * Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array board, return true if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.
 * The board is a 3 x 3 array that consists of characters ' ', 'X', and 'O'. The ' ' character represents an empty square.
 * Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
 *
 * 	Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
 * 	The first player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places 'O' characters.
 * 	'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
 * 	The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
 * 	The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
 * 	No more moves can be played if the game is over.
 *
 *  
 * Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe1-grid.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 253px;" />
 * Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
 *
 * Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe2-grid.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 253px;" />
 * Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe4-grid.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 253px;" />
 * Input: board = ["XOX","O O","XOX"]
 * Output: true
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	board.length == 3
 * 	board[i].length == 3
 * 	board[i][j] is either 'X', 'O', or ' '.
 *
