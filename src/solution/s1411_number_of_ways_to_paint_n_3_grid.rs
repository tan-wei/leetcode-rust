/**
 * [1411] Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid
 *
 * You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
 * Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/26/e1.png" style="width: 400px; height: 257px;" />
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 5000
 * Output: 30228214
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == grid.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 5000
 *
