/**
 * [2318] Number of Distinct Roll Sequences
 *
 * You are given an integer n. You roll a fair 6-sided dice n times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:
 * <ol>
 * 	The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
 * 	There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the i^th roll is equal to the value of the j^th roll, then abs(i - j) > 2.
 * </ol>
 * Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 184
 * Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2, 3, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1), etc.
 * Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
 * (1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).
 * (1, 2, 3, 6) is invalid since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 6 = 3.
 * There are a total of 184 distinct sequences possible, so we return 184.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 22
 * Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2).
 * Some invalid sequences are (3, 6), (2, 4) since the greatest common divisor is not equal to 1.
 * There are a total of 22 distinct sequences possible, so we return 22.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^4
 *
