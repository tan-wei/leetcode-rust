/**
 * [2588] Count the Number of Beautiful Subarrays
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you can:
 *
 * 	Choose two different indices i and j such that 0 <= i, j < nums.length.
 * 	Choose a non-negative integer k such that the k^th bit (0-indexed) in the binary representation of nums[i] and nums[j] is 1.
 * 	Subtract 2^k from nums[i] and nums[j].
 *
 * A subarray is beautiful if it is possible to make all of its elements equal to 0 after applying the above operation any number of times (including zero).
 * Return the number of beautiful subarrays in the array nums.
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 * Note: Subarrays where all elements are initially 0 are considered beautiful, as no operation is needed.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,3,1,2,4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 2 beautiful subarrays in nums: [4,3,1,2,4] and [4,3,1,2,4].
 * - We can make all elements in the subarray [3,1,2] equal to 0 in the following way:
 *   - Choose [3, 1, 2] and k = 1. Subtract 2^1 from both numbers. The subarray becomes [1, 1, 0].
 *   - Choose [1, 1, 0] and k = 0. Subtract 2^0 from both numbers. The subarray becomes [0, 0, 0].
 * - We can make all elements in the subarray [4,3,1,2,4] equal to 0 in the following way:
 *   - Choose [4, 3, 1, 2, 4] and k = 2. Subtract 2^2 from both numbers. The subarray becomes [0, 3, 1, 2, 0].
 *   - Choose [0, 3, 1, 2, 0] and k = 0. Subtract 2^0 from both numbers. The subarray becomes [0, 2, 0, 2, 0].
 *   - Choose [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] and k = 1. Subtract 2^1 from both numbers. The subarray becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,10,4]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There are no beautiful subarrays in nums.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
