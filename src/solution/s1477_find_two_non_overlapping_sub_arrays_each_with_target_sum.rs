/**
 * [1477] Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum
 *
 * You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
 * You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
 * Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
 * 	1 <= target <= 10^8
 *
