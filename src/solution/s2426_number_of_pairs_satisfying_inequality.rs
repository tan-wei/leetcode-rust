/**
 * [2426] Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, each of size n, and an integer diff. Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that:
 *
 * 	0 <= i < j <= n - 1 and
 * 	nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff.
 *
 * Return the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,2,1], diff = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
 * 1. i = 0, j = 1: 3 - 2 <= 2 - 2 + 1. Since i < j and 1 <= 1, this pair satisfies the conditions.
 * 2. i = 0, j = 2: 3 - 5 <= 2 - 1 + 1. Since i < j and -2 <= 2, this pair satisfies the conditions.
 * 3. i = 1, j = 2: 2 - 5 <= 2 - 1 + 1. Since i < j and -3 <= 2, this pair satisfies the conditions.
 * Therefore, we return 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [3,-1], nums2 = [-2,2], diff = -1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == nums1.length == nums2.length
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	-10^4 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4
 * 	-10^4 <= diff <= 10^4
 *
