/**
 * [2379] Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the i^th block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
 * You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.
 * In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
 * so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW".
 * It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
 * Therefore, we return 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
 * Therefore, we return 0.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == blocks.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 100
 * 	blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
 * 	1 <= k <= n
 *
