/**
 * [2342] Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].
 * Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions. If no such pair of indices exists, return -1.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
 * Output: 54
 * Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
 * - (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
 * - (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
 * So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 *
